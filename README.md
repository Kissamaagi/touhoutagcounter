# touhoutagcounter
Script for making a google sheets sheet that has information on danbooru tags on touhou characters. The tags are provided in the tags.txt file,
so you could technically use any character tags on danbooru. The finished sheet will count how many of the character's art is tagged safe, questionable and
explicit. It will also count the percentages of each, and an additional NSFW percentage, which is the amount of both questionable and explicit. 

You will need ezsheets and google sheets credentials to use it. 

Currently doesn't work, not sure if it's something in the code or if it is with google sheets.
